Other things:

install solarized for vim: http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized
install solarized for terminal: https://github.com/tomislav/osx-terminal.app-colors-solarized

IntelliJ:

* Darkula theme with solarized dark color scheme
* using ideavim with regular osx keymap to get normal shortcuts
* Change the file colors to use the darkula ones
* Changed the background to mirror the vim version of solarized dark, the intellij version wasn't quite the same darkness
