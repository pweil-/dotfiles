Other things:

install solarized for vim and intellij: http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized
	after installing for intellij set the font back to the default font size and line spacing.  Also, using the default
	look and feel
install solarized for terminal: https://github.com/tomislav/osx-terminal.app-colors-solarized

IntelliJ:

* Darkula theme with solarized dark color scheme
* using ideavim with regular osx keymap to get normal shortcuts
* Change the file colors to use the darkula ones
* Changed the background to mirror the vim version of solarized dark, the intellij version wasn't quite the same darkness
